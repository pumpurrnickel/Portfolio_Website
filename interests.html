          <p>Although I've been playing piano for years, I still don't know
            how to read sheet music. I mostly play songs by ear. I can also
            play the clarinet, ukulele, and lyre. I've been told I'm a good singer.

          <p>I like to play a variety of games, but I'm a <em>fiend</em> for rhythm games. My favorite one right now
            is 'Taiko no Tatsujin' on the Nintendo Switch, but I also like playing
            'Osu!' or 'Friday Night Funkin'.

          <p>I make miniatures as one of my other side hobbies. I've been
             working on making buildings from the game 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons'.
             As of right now, I have made the Able Sister's shop and Nook's Cranny with working
             miniature lights inside

          <p>I sometimes stream games on Twitch for fun. I've also done Twitch emotes, overlays,
             and 'PNGtuber' character commissions for other Twitch streamers.

          <p>I like keeping a small drawing sketchbook to draw my surrounding environments and people that pass by,
            mainly to keep practicing composition and human anatomy.
