          I'm originally from the Philippines, but I moved to the United States
          after my parents found work in New York City. My dad would often bring
          me to his architecture firm, and I started to foster a love for the
          arts whenever he'd let me play with his watercolor sets. I graduated
          from North Carolina State University with a bachelor's in Art +
          Design, specializing in creating 3D models, animations, and
          environments for games.

          Though I do a lot of digital work, I am most comfortable working with
          traditional paints such as watercolor and gouache. I love creating pieces
          that tell a rich narrative, which is why I love to render environments and
          focusing on the tiny details.
